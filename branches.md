# Branches

* `Main`
  * This is my development branch. It is usually the most up-to-date with my freshest ideas and tests, but is probably broken in more than one way at any given time. Only use if you don't care and know what you are doing.
* `5.1 - 5.2`
  * Branches supporting specific engine versions. These are probably what you should be using. Pick whichever one matches your project.
    * As Epic releases new versions, I move Heart to them \*relatively\* soon, and I will \*try\* to support at least the last two/three branches when possible, although since I generally will use any new features if they are an improvement, it is likely that more older branches may have missing features, so feature parity is not guaranteed, it should be expected that only the most recent has everything you might see in my discord posts.
    * When I no longer support an Unreal version, the last commit on its branch will be Tagged, and the branch deleted.
  * `Others`
    * Any other branch you see pop up is likely a short lived test for a new feature. Like `Main`, use at your own risk.
